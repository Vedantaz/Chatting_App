ï»¿     i am taking id as  ->   const isSelected = selectedConversation?._id == user._id;
  const isOnline = onlineUsers.includes(user._id);   


  soln :    const isSelected = selectedConversation?._id === user?._id;
  const isOnline = user ? onlineUsers.includes(user._id) : false;


2. I created a middleware secureroute, but it is getting the cookie token , how can be the reason behind it.   trhe sample code  -> const token = req.cookies.jwt;
    console.log("token in secureRoute: ", token);    i importted the ? import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";  

    =>  now token is coming, I set credentials is == true, in cors 
    == cors: {
    origin: "http://localhost:3001",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
    credentials: true,
  },


  Also, -> I aded the axios credentials == true -> axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;


// IMP ->> I added the credentials :  true, in server.js in cors. Also,   
I updated the JWT file like {userId} :  
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId }, process.env.JWT_TOKEN, {
    expiresIn: "100d",
  });  
  Instead of :: 
  const token = jwt.sign( userId , process.env.JWT_TOKEN, {
    expiresIn: "100d",
  });  


  3. Login and SignUp, allUsers is successful, but it can't able to render towards the left, right alike dashboard page for messaging it.
  => authUser coming is undefined
